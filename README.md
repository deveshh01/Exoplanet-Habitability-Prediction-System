# Exoplanet-Habitability-Prediction-System
Machine learning–based system that predicts exoplanet habitability using real NASA/Kepler data. It cleans and analyzes planetary features, trains models to generate a 0–100 habitability score, classifies planets, and explains predictions with feature importance and visualizations.
